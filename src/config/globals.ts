// 7.1 - G – Text size(electronic display)
// A voting system’s electronic display must be capable of showing all information in a range of text sizes that voters can select from, with a  default text size at least 4.8 mm(based on the height of the uppercase I), allowing voters to both increase and decrease the text size.
// The voting system may meet this requirement in one of the following ways:
// 1.    Provide continuous scaling with a minimum increment of .5 mm that covers the full range of text sizes from 3.5 mm to 9.0 mm.
// 2.    Provide at least four discrete text sizes, in which the main ballot options fall within one of these ranges.
//   a) 3.5 - 4.2 mm(10 - 12 points)
// b) 4.8 - 5.6 mm(14 - 16 points)
// c) 6.4 - 7.1 mm(18 - 20 points)
// d) 8.5 - 9.0 mm(24 - 25 points)
